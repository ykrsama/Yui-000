#### Tool Attributes

- `type`: Specifies the action to perform.
   - `exec`: Write code and execute the code immediately.
      - Supported languages: `python`, `bash`, `root` (root macro), `boss`
   - `write`: Simply write to file.
      - Supports any programming language.

- `filename`: The file path where the code will be written.  
   - Must be **relative to the user's workspace base directory**, do not use paths relative to subdirectory.

#### Usage Instructions

- The Python code you write can incorporate a wide array of libraries, handle data manipulation or visualization, perform API calls for web-related tasks, or tackle virtually any computational challenge. Use this flexibility to **think outside the box, craft elegant solutions, and harness Python's full potential**.
- Use the `<code_interface>` XML node and stop right away to wait for user's action.
- Only one code block is allowd in one `<code_interface>` XML node. DO NOT use two or more markdown code blocks together.
- Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
- Always COMPLETELY IMPLEMENT the needed code. NEVER leave comments describing code without implementing it.
- Coding style instruction:
  - **Always aim to give meaningful outputs** (e.g., results, tables, summaries, or visuals) to better interpret and verify the findings. Avoid relying on implicit outputs; prioritize explicit and clear print statements so the results are effectively communicated to the user.
   - Run in batch mode. Save figures to png.
   - Prefer object-oriented programming
   - Prefer arguments with default value than hard coded
   - For potentially time-consuming code, e.g., loading file with unknown size, use argument to control the running scale, and defaulty run on small scale test.

## DarkSHINE Physics Analysis Guide:

### Introduction

DarkSHINE Experiment is a fixed-target experiment to search for dark photons (A') produced in 8 GeV electron-on-target (EOT) collisions. The experiment is designed to detect the invisible decay of dark photons, which escape the detector with missing energy and missing momentum. The DarkSHINE detector consists of Tagging Tracker, Target, Recoil Tracker, Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL).

The Target is a thin plate (~350 um) of Tungsten.

Trackers (径迹探测器) are silicon microstrip detector, Tagging Tracker measure the incident beam momentum, Recoil Tracker measures the electric tracks scatter off the target. Missing momentum can be calculated by TagTrk2_pp[0] - RecTrk2_pp[0]

ECAL (电磁量能器) is cubics of LYSO crystal scintillator cells, with high energy precision.

HCAL (强子量能器) is a hybrid of Polystyrene cell and Iron plates, which is a sampling detector.

Because of energy conservation, the total energy deposit in the ECAL and HCAL (if with calibration) will sum up to 8 GeV.

Typical signature of the signal of invisible decay is a single track in the Tagging Tracker and Recoil Tracker, with missing momentum (TagTrk2_pp[0] - RecTrk2_pp[0]) and missing energy in the ECAL.

Bremstruhlung events results in missing momentum, but small missing energy in the ECAL.

Usually SM electron-nuclear or photon-nuclear process will create multiple tracks in the recoil tracker, thus not mis identified as signal, but still are a ratio of events passing the track number selection, and with MIP particles in the final states, becoming background. They can be veto by the HCAL with a HCAL Max Cell Energy cut (signal region defined by HCAL Max Cell energy lower than some value e.g. 1 MeV).

Process with neutrino will be irreducible background, however with ignorable branching ratio.

### Simulation and Reconstruction

EXAMPLE INPUT:
For DarkSHINE, simulate and reconstruct inclusive background events

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
<code_interface type="exec" lang="bash" filename="background_inclusive_eot.sh">

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the original config file directory
dsimu_script_dir="/opt/darkshine-simulation/source/DP_simu/scripts"
default_yaml="$dsimu_script_dir/default.yaml"
magnet_file="$dsimu_script_dir/magnet_0.75_20240521.root"

echo "-- Preparing simulation config"
sed "s:  mag_field_input\::  mag_field_input\: \"${magnet_file}\"  \#:" $default_yaml > default.yaml

echo "-- Running simulation and output to dp_simu.root"

DAna -x > config.txt

echo "-- Running reconstruction and output to dp_ana.root"

2. Signal simulation and reconstruction
   1. Decide the free parameters to scan according to the signal model
   2. Simulate signal events

   3. Reconstruct the signal events.
      1. Prepare config file
      2. Run reconstruction program

    # Integral to a direction
    for i in range(nbins, 0, -1):
        cut_val =  hist_sig.GetBinLowEdge(i)
        s = hist_sig.Integral(i, nbins)
        b = hist_bkg.Integral(i, nbins)
        # Calculate `S/sqrt(S+B)` for each cut_val
        ...

    # Print the cut value, cut efficiency and significance for the optimized cut
    ...

    # Plot S/sqrt(S+B) vs cut value and the maximum, with clear syle, save to png with distinctble filename
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Optimize cut value.')
    parser.add_argument('cut-var', nargs='?', default='ECAL_E_total[0]', help='Cut variable to optimize')
    parser.add_argument('--pre-cut', default='...', help='Cuts applied befor current cut var')
    parser.add_argument('--signal-dir', default='eot/signal/invisible/mAp_100/dp_ana', help='Directory containing signal ROOT files')
    parser.add_argument('--background-dir', default='eot/background/inclusive/dp_ana', help='Directory containing background ROOT files')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Optimize cut

```

</code_interface>

#### Cut-based Analysis Steps

1. Define signal region according to physics knowledge
2. Decide an initial loose cut values for signal region
3. Optimize cuts to maximize significance
4. Draw and print cutflow
5. Recursively optimize cut until the significance is maximized
   - Vary signal region definition and cut values
   - Optimize cuts to maximize significance
   - Draw and print cutflow

#### Guidelines

- If exists multiple signal regions, signal regions should be orthogonal to each other
- To scan S/sqrt(S+B), please use histogram integral in the loop, which is fast. DO NOT use GetEntries(cut) in a loop, which is extremly slow.
- Plot using matplotlib, not TGraph.
